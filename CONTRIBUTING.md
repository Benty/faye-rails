# Contributor guidelines

Please note that [github issues](https://github.com/jamesotron/faye-rails/issues) are not a support channel.  If you need help with Faye then I suggest you try [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com).

If you're having trouble running faye-rails on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) you're most likely running into per-dyno connection limitations, etc.  Look at [MessageRocket](https://messagerocket.co/) as a possible alternative.

If there is an actual bug with faye-rails (and not Faye itself) then feel free to raise an issue.

Cheers.

James.
